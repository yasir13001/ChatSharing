***User:***  
I want a weekly workout plan to get lean, with a flat and defined abdomen, toned arms (not too big), strong glutes, and legs. I can train 4 days per week. I'm male, 23 years old, around 1.55 to 1.65 meters tall, and weigh around 60 kg. I would like to reach 50–55 kg.

Should I jog a 5th day?

***Assistant:***

Yes! Adding a 5th day of jogging can help you lose fat faster and boost cardiovascular endurance.

Option 1 – Moderate Jog (Fat-burning zone):
- Duration: 30 to 40 minutes  
- Intensity: You should be able to talk while jogging (60-70% HR max)  

Option 2 – HIIT:
- 5 min warm-up  
- 8 rounds of: 30 sec sprint + 90 sec walking  
- 5 min cool-down  
- Total: ~25-30 minutes
